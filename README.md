Did the two assembly sub-assignments and commented in them, there is a lot of comments to hopefully make it as readable as assambly can be haha, I tested the sieve one and it seems to work but since I ade to functions in a bodyless file for the multiplication one I haven't tested it, I just assume/hope it works
